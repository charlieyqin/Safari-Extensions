Listen in Snowtape
==================

"Listen in Snowtape" is a Safari Extension that lets users listen to radio streams from RadioTime.com directly in Snowtape. Such streams can also be added to a user's radio station library. A recent release of Snowtape must be installed in order for the extension to work. Not all streaming formats are also supported by Snowtape, and may not play.
